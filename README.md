# java-IDE

Notwithstanding with its name, this IDE, created just a simple project; has the following feature-

- It offers compilation for C, C++, Java
- Offers multiple extension handling
- Provides a cross-platform environment
- Offers multiple themes for the IDE
- Offers browser-running capability for fast web development

**TODO**
- Add support for Python,Vitae (another project of mine :) )
- Add nifty short-cuts (remember vim? ) 
- Add syntax highlighting and other intelli-sense features.
